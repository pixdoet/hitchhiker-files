HITCHHIKER-FILES

This repository contains what I use to recreate the 2013-2017 "hitchhiker" layout. The files here are for personal use only, please do not redistribute it for self gain!

/styles/hitchhiker_search_bar.css:
This file contains CSS for the hitchhiker search bar, a hitchhiker comment layout, 2016 player design and channel buttons. I recommend using the channel buttons alongside 7KT's script, which make them look wayyy better.

/scripts/w8r.js
This is a script created to mimic the watch8 layout using YouTube's css and assets. It's made by members of the Goodtube community and works well for daily usage. 

I'll add more files to this repo soon.
