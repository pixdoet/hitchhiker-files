HITCHHIKER-FILES

This repository contains what I use to recreate the 2013-2017 "hitchhiker" layout. The files here are for personal use only, please do not redistribute it for self gain!

hitchhiker_search_bar.css:
This file contains CSS for the hitchhiker search bar, a hitchhiker comment layout, 2016 player design and channel buttons. I recommend using the channel buttons alongside 7KT's script, which make them look wayyy better.

I'll add more files to this repo soon.
